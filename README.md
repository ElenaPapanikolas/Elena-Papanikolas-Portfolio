# Elena Papanikolas Portfolio


## Description

For this project I wanted to create a portfolio of current work samples for potential employers to see and asses my work. Before doing anything else I wrote out and designed what I wanted my webpage to look like, using wire-framing. Then I wrote the base of the HTML file. Next I styled the elements in CSS, adding  classes along the way to further the styling. After going back and changing the color scheme and images a few times, I was able to get something I was happy with. I implemented things we learned like pseudo classes, and added :hover and :root elements. I added flexbox and media queries to allow the page to be reactive when viewed on different sized screens. A very challenging part of this project was getting all the styling the way I wanted and then for it to look good as I scaled down the page size. It was challenging to style the images the right way, to get the size I wanted. As I progress on my journey I look forward to learning the ins and outs of flexbox and CSS in general.
